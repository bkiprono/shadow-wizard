## What's this?
This is a sample npm package for shadow wizard
:octacat

## Getting started
How to install: 
To install, use the command below:

`npm i shadow-wizard-dev-test`


## Publishing Releases

To create a tag run the following:

```javascript
git tag v1.0.0
```

To push the tags to Github, run the following command:

```javascript
git push origin --tags
```

### Tagging suggestions

It’s common practice to prefix your version names with the letter v. Some good tag names might be `v1.0.0` or `v2.3.4`.
If the tag isn’t meant for production use, add a pre-release version after the version name. Some good pre-release versions might be `v0.2.0-alpha` or `v5.9-beta.3`.
